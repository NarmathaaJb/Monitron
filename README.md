# 🚀 Monitron

Monitron is a developer-built, end-to-end service monitoring and observability platform designed to help engineers understand **what is happening inside their systems in real time**.

It simulates real production services, collects metrics and logs, stores them reliably, and visualizes system health through dashboards — forming a strong monitoring foundation for future AI-driven reliability engineering.

## 🎯 Project Vision

Modern systems fail in complex and unpredictable ways.  
Monitron is built to:

- Observe running services
- Capture operational signals
- Centralize metrics and logs
- Provide clear visibility into system health

The platform follows a **foundation-first approach**, where accurate monitoring and observability are prioritized before intelligence, prediction, or automation.
